This is our public submission to the Boston College 2024 Hack The Heights Hackathon.

It is an AI mental-health focussed producitvity manager called MyBaldwin that keeps tracks of tasks,
sets timers for studying and breaks, and features an AI Badlwin chat bot that gives advice on anything
producitivity or mental health related. The project runs as a chrome extension in teh browser.

*NOTE* This version of the code requires a hard coded openAI api key, which we did not upload.
